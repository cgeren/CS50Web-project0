        <li>The exact area of the Chagos Islands Atoll is unknown, but the entire <br /> archipelago is roughly 56 km/26 square miles.</li>
        <li>The atoll is a great natural resource for fish and cocounts, which are all shipped to the <a href = "diegogarcia.html".><u>Diego Garcia Atoll</u></a></li>
        <li>The atoll offers a hot and humid tropical oceanic climate, yet it is <br /> controlled and moderated by trade winds.</li>
        <li>The first inhabitants of the Chagos Islands Atoll were presumably lost <br /> fishermen, who would live off the atoll for days until rescued.</li>
        <li>Recently, the UK has purchased the atoll for portions of the US military and <br /> to establish the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).</li>
