# CS50Web-project0
 The first project in Harvard's CS50 Web Programming Course with Python and Java Script. A website that is all about atolls, peruse among my personal favorites from the home page and learn more about them and their unique properties. Ignore the config file, it made me choose one in order to launch the site through github pages.

 index.html - contains references to both boostrap's and my stylesheets, my use of bootstrap's grid system (seen in the form of the six gridded atolls on the website), and my table

 chagosislands.html/ducie.html/kure.html/ospreyreef.html/diegogarcia.html/nakuoro.html - I wanted to put these into an islands file and I tried to at the very end but I had a lot of references to the files and I would have to change the path in many other places so I didn't want to, I am sorry. In short, all of these files simply contain the html for the layout of the islands pages and the information displayed on them.

 styles.css - The main stylesheet that I used for the majority of the stylistic choices on the website.

 stylesscss.css - Compiled stylesheet for my SCSS code.

 stylesscss.scss - The SCSS code, short and sweet. Contains two variables for link colors and an example of nesting and inheritance all in one.

 One of the links that I was using for my images broke so I had to download it instead so that's why I have png. In hindsight I imagine solely using links is quite dangerous because they may be taken donw. In the future I'll most likely download my images and include them in some sort of images folder.
