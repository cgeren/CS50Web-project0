        <li>The Osprey Reef is a submerged atoll! It covers 195 km/75 mi squared.</li>
        <li>The atoll has often by quoted to be the "ultimate reef diving adventure".</li>
        <li>The reef offers tons of "big fish" action due mainly to it being an atoll.</li>
        <li>The deeper parts are deprived of oxygen, driving larger fish towards the cliffs of the lagoon where oxygen may be found.</li>
        <li>Osprey Reef is located off of the northeast coast of Australia, 350km north of Cairns.</li>
